- Git settings: username, emil, editor, SSH vs HTTPS, gitignore
- Useful Git Commands: creating repo, showing logs, manipulating files
- Git Branching: making branches, switching between them, merging branches
- Other: fixing merge conflicts, GitFlow branching, syncing with an upstream repo, making pull requests
