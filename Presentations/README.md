# Presentations

This section contains information about and links to past presentations. It could be useful for those who missed the original presentation, want a refresher on a topic, or are trying to do an updated version of a past activity. 

The slide show is usually done with Google Slide, because it's easy to create and share with everyone. In the spirit of open, there will be an effort to use an open source presentation framework like [Reveal.js][Reveal] or [Remark.js][Remark]. They require some basic HTML and CSS knowledge, but as a result are self hosted and more inline with the open philosophy.
