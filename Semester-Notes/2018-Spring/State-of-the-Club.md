# State of the Club 

### *Spring 2018/Fall 2017*

## Meetings 

This year the club dropped Development sessions in favor of focusing Casual Coding sessions on working on projects and General Body Meetings (GBM) on covering interesting/useful open source topics. Casual Coding sessions are usually in the same room in Marston, while GBMs have been in various rooms in the Reitz Union. Both meetings are popular amongst active members (in fact, Casual Coding might need two rooms next year), though GBMs still struggle in brining and retaining non-members. Though, more topical meetings like Cryptocurrency and Video Game development were much more attractive to non-members. In the future we will need to decide how many meetings should be related to club projects to help with development, and how many should be more topical to bring in new people. It could also be useful to put together documentation on giving presentations. 

We also tried Code Jams this semester, a day long "hackathon-like" meeting to help students learn and practice a specific technology or skill. These were held on Saturdays in the Reitz. Code Jams were the least attended meeting of the semester, though people who went seemed to do enjoy them. It's length may seem intimidating to students. It could be useful to make practice portion of the event be more guided, to help attendees feel more comfortable. Trying different times and lengths, especially going into football season, may be a way to improve attendance. 

Finally, the club had two LAN parties this year. In Fall it was during reading days, which meant some people were studying, but it ended up bringing in more people than in Spring, where we tried having it right before Spring Break. Each LAN party and Code Jam had food, which was a large portion of our budget. It would be useful to plan the budget more ahead of time and mix funding sources (MOSSN, ACM, GitHub, etc).

## Projects

The two main projects this semester have been updating the website and the Marston vs West game. We've had quite a bit of interest in both. Most new members start with the website, but many more experienced programmers moved to the game. Both have had very active development throughout the Spring semester, which was an improvement over previous ones. We believe this is because we have made an effort to get members started on projects right away. We are also more heavily using GitHub project management features like issues, which has helped people get started and track development. I would like to see more formal documentation and processes forming to help new members and project leads work on and manage the projects.

Each project is web based, so the was an overlap in some technology used. In the future it would be nice to diversify so people have other types of technologies they can learn. We also found that a lot of DAS majors were interested in the game, so it might pay to more heavily advertise in those classes.

One aspect that we have failed at is working on existing open source projects. It can be really intimidating and difficult to get started in an existing code base. Doing events dedicated to this (maybe with other MOSSN clubs) might help people get more comfortable contributing to other projects. 

## Members

We've had an incremental increase in active members this semester, and kept attendance up throughout the year, even during exam periods. This is good progress, and trying to bring in more members from non-CS majors might help increase the member base.

We could more heavily advertise some GBMs to specific classes throughout the year to help grow membership after the first couple of weeks. Currently, most the advertising done is for the first GBM, and consequently most new members join then.

The club would also be improved by increasing it's diversity. We have made some progress, but more targeted collaboration may be a way to help this.

## Organization

All club documentation and resources (aside from personal information) has been moved to the GitHub. This has cleaned up the Google Drive and should reflect the club's dedication to open leadership. More organized (and prettier) documentation could help onboard new members and officers, as well as help them learn about new topics (like Git and TypeScript). [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) or [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) might be good places to look for this.

These could be integrated with the updated website to create a more seem-less experience. This along with the in progress development of showing upcoming events should make the website more useful to existing members and help show off the club to non-members. Adding features like meeting sign ins, and email notifications could also help this.

Towards the end of the semester we settled on a new more unique logo to help the club stand out. In addition we finally printed our first T-shirts. We will have a club server as well, both so members can use it and for the club to host projects on it. It might be beneficial to create a new officer position to manage the server (to let members on to it, kick off bad actors, and make sure hosted projects are maintained). 

## Outreach

The club has continued it's outreach behavior working to do workshops with other clubs, both SIGs and non-SIGs. We should try to do other things than hosting workshops, like bringing in others or maybe a joint Code Jam. 

In the fall we tried the first Codeathon, a months long, team based competition. Three other clubs helped host parts of the competition. The goal was that students would be introduced to the type of things each club did, and would also provide a more constructive way for participants to work on extra circular projects. It unfortunately did not retain many competitors, so it's format would need to be heavily revised.

This year we also helped start the [Mozilla Open Source Student Network](https://opensource.mozilla.community). We've had regular meetings with other clubs and are trying to help expand the network to be more useful to us. I've also been able to become a GitHub Campus Expert, which should help bring more resources towards events, as well as advertising the club to other students.

## Conclusion 

The club feels very strong right now. It has an active group of members who work on projects. It's also gaining more recognition in the UF CS community. Next year the club should improve it's on-boarding and documentation to help bring aboard students and officers, experiment more with Code Jams, and try to increase the diversity of it's member base.
