# Fall 2017 Planning

## Goals for this Semester

For this semester, because our Open Source Club is still relatively new, we have decided to focus on two main goals:

### 1. Recruit More Club Members

This means not only increasing our efforts to recruit potential club members more consistently and frequently, but it also means focusing on keeping those club members around, a problem that we have found difficult as we currently have a retention rate of about 1/5th.

### 2. Complete More Projects

As a project-oriented club we believe that the second biggest issue of concern is the limited amount of projects that we have completed and the way they have been managed/organized so far. Hopefully, as we center our focus towards solving the various problems of the way we have addressed projects in the club such as scale, difficulty, and organization, the amount of show-casable projects will begin to build and positively affect the many other aspects of our club like recruitment/retention.

## The Roadmap for this Semester

So, on the agenda this semester for our club is **TMW**:

**T**ech Talks  
**M**eetings and  
**W**orkshops

For tech talks, right now, we are aiming to get a representative from Mozilla to come down and talk at UF about Open Source.

As for Meetings, we have come out with a layout for what we plan to do:

1. Working on open source (club) projects
2. An introduction to the command line
3. How to linux (installation to development) 
4. Workshop on Android modification/mobile development
