### Meeting Summary
- We covered the basics of installing and using Git and the concept of version control software and why it's needed when working on Open 
Source Projects. 
- We also covered how to find an Open Source Project andhow contributing to it means more than just writing code. After all, someone has to 
test the software and write documentation for it.
- Note: Having code posted on Github does not make it Open Source. Having the correct licencse does.
- Finally, we discussed Gitflow and Open Source Project Management. An important skill when it comes to Open Source Projects
is actually finishing the project. Here we discuss methods of organizing your workflow in order to make that as easy as possible.
