# State of the Club 

## *Spring 2017*

## Meetings 

The club started Causal Coding Sessions this semester. The idea behind these meetings, is that they happen in between or right after classes (for convenience) and create an informal environment for easily working on projects and homework (building community and providing regular work time). We have two of these a week, in either Marston, the Fishbowl, or the Reitz. The Fishbowl can be distracting and busy, so we may go there less. These meetings are popular, and bring in about ten members each meeting, and will bring in someone interested every now and then. 

As a consequence, the number of GBMs and Dev Sessions were reduced to alternating every other week. At both we make an effort to have people give a status update on what work they’ve done (to give credit to them and update everyone on project status). GBM’s have a specific open source topic (to bring new people in) or activity (like elections). After that, they are treated mostly like Dev Sessions, where remaining time is used for working on club projects. Both of these tend to bring in about six members, and typically no new members. There may be some work to do on these in the future, to make these more popular and bring in new members. 

In the future, introducing a new type of meeting would be good. One option would be something like a hackathon. It could be about a specific Open Source technology or club projects. The hope is that we could use to bring new people in or update people about projects. Another option would be a social event, such as a LAN party. The goal with this would be something fun and that would build community. Both of these options will be explored more in the future. 

## Projects

We started this semester with the possibility of having two or three active projects. The course scheduler and website template being the primary two. However, most people were attracted to the course scheduler so that became our only official active project. This is a sufficiently advanced project that has enough work to keep people interested. It is making slow, but steady progress.

The downside is that there is less diversity for members to choose from, and no easy way to start. So having more options for people to work on would be good. This would require at least a few members and a project lead to make it “active”. This essentially means we need more members to make more projects feasible. 

It may also be beneficial to always have an easy project ongoing. This would make it easy to bring in new members to the club without overwhelming them. This may also be a good route for people who are busy, or who are interested in project leadership. 

## Members

This semester there has been a good increase in the number of members. It is getting to the point it’s sustainable. Of course more growth will be good. As mentioned above, more members will help work on more projects. It seems that most new members came on at the beginning of the year, with only a few that joined after that. We need to increase our advertising and recruitment throughout the year.

## Organization

We added a Secretary, Social Chair, External Relations Chair, and Project Lead to help the club. This has been a very positive move, as it’s helped share the administrative load, and allowed for more time to work on projects. There no plans to add additional positions (aside from new project leads per project), as there seems to be a good distribution of responsibilities right now. 

We are doing our best to move as much as we can onto GitHub in the spirit of open development and for easy organization. It’d be good for this trend to continue, with more detail towards administrative and project documentation. One additional thing to add to the GitHub, would be presentations. 

We also need to update the website. It’s slow and doesn't automatically pull updates from the calendar/Facebook or Github. This could be a total rewrite, but any improvement to the existing site are welcome. 

## Outreach

The club has had a frequent contact with ACM and the other SIGs. At joint meetings, representatives have helped make decisions and suggest ideas. We have done collaborations with other clubs, and it would be good to do more. It benefits the community and potentially attracts members. We have also proposed a jointly hosted programming competition (to have SIGs work together and attract programmers), though the other SIGs need to decide on this. 

## Conclusion 

The club is at a healthy point. It's gaining members, working on projects, and out reaching with other clubs. The primary goals of next semester are to grow our member base, start and finish more diverse projects, and create more engaging meetings.
