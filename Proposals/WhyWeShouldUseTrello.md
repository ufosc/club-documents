# Why We Should Use Trello for Project Management

### First, why we should have a tool for managing projects in the Open Source Club.

While working on the Website Template this Summer, I am finding it difficult to track every thought I have in terms of planning and adapting to unforeseen problems that show up when working on it. Here are some thoughts I had when thinking about this problem:

* If tracking my thoughts during Summer ( a time where school isn't there to get in my way and I can spend many hours a day thinking/ working on the project) then this problem would only get worse when school starts back up.

* I have been working on this project mostly solo and I feel that a project with multiple people working on it would become even messier when it comes to selecting tasks to work on for the project and being on the same page when it comes to design.

* I have also thought about how these "unforeseen problems" can often lead to setbacks in terms of completion time and also lead to complex/ difficult questions about project direction and how to progress.

* But the worst part is that if I imagine doing this project during a normal school semester where my mental energy is drained and the time I can work on the project has been stretched thin and far throughout multiple weeks, then memory and forgetting become an issue when coming across "design" questions.

Long Story short, I have come to the conclusion that the issue is organization and the lack of a centralized hub when it came to project management. This is where I believe that the a project oriented club like the OSC should have a standard project management tool and procedure. (specifically Trello).

### Okay, So Why Trello?

* the flexible card layout allows for easy and quick adaptation for when "unforeseen problems" arise.

* The ease of adding members and keeping them up to date with what's happening in the project through notifications on Slack. It's a pretty good Team-oriented software that also integrates with Google Calendar.

* But perhaps the most important reason is that it is a centralized hub that is very easy to access and keeps everyone on the same page when it comes to project vision and tasks that need to be done.
