# Open Source Class Syllabus

## Club Motivation

The Open Source Club believes establishing an Open Source Class would help achieve the following:

- Increase the understanding of open source on campus
- Promote collaboration both with other students and external projects
- Provide students time to work on project

### Club and Class Distinction

The club and class would remain distinct entities, though involvement in both is encouraged. Some club meetings and activities could overlap with the class (for example a casual coding session may overlap with a lab or extra credit for attending a mini-hackathon). The club could be a good source of TAs, but TAs would not have any inherent leadership in the club. Voting would only be done by active club members (as defined in the club constitution). Projects could be worked on by members of both, but proper collaboration (as defined by the project leader) must be maintained. A clear distinction between work must also be maintained for grading purposes. 

## Description

This course teaches the importance of open source software and how to contribute to open source projects. Students will participate in a semester long open source project. This is either chosen from a provided list or approved by the professor. 3 credits (preferable). 

## Schedule

One lecture period per week with required lab sections (2 to 3) for working on projects.

## Material

- Definition of open source and free software
- History of open source
- Common open source licenses
- Open development
	- Keeping code open
	- Giving and receiving feedback
	- Common project structure/organization
	- Public management
- Open source in business
- Introduction to common open source software
	- Git (and using it with GitHub)
	- Linux
	- Bash

## Grading 

Though information taught in lectures will be graded with quizzes/exams, the majority of points would be given from the project work. This would be decided based off weekly submissions of what work was accomplished, problems encountered, future goals, etc. This is graded on effort shown and value added to the project. Each group will also give presentations half-way and at the end of the semester on project status.

- (10%) Attendance
