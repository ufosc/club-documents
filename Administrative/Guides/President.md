# President's Guide

## Preface

I'm writing this for a few reasons. The first, and most obvious is to be a guide for future Presidents. I hope what I've learned since starting the club can prove to be valuable. The second is to give other officers a format for creating their own guide (which don't have to have a preface or be quite as long as this). The third and most selfish of me, is to explain why this club matters to me, and what values I would like to see it keep as it moves forward. 

The other thing I want to make clear is that this is a **living document**. I encourage future presidents to modify it to include their thoughts and give better advice than myself (not to mention some of this might be wrong at one point). Don't worry about removing something, we're using Git after all. 

## Responsibilities

- Providing the guiding vision for the club
- Acting project lead for projects without a project lead
- Technical responsibility to be able to help other members
- Oversee officer and general body meetings
- Access to all club accounts
- Oversee officers and projects
- Year-long term

## Advice

I'll talk each point that I think my thoughts can add value to.

> Providing the guiding vision for the club

The club was originally founded with the intent _to Promote, Support, and Create Open Source projects_. This extends beyond just software, though that is the major audience we attract. We are different from other clubs because we let students pitch project ideas, regardless of the topic and then work on those. We are not limited to a specific competition or topic. 

Letting student's choose the projects can lead to some really creative and unique ideas, but it also means we end up not working on existing open source projects. While I am very glad students can come up with their own ideas, we can't forget that open source is about building on existing community work. More of an attempt at working on existing projects would be a good goal.

_Regardless of what you decide to do, make it something people can get excited about, and that stays true to open development and leadership._

> Technical responsibility to be able to help other members

This is both the easiest and hardest thing. The way I have learned and grown my knowledge is by staying curious and playing with things. When I see or hear something I'm not familiar with I look into it. This sometime means I go down a rabbit hole, but I have always ended up understanding more. When something really intrigues you, actually use it. See what it's good at, see what it's not meant for, break it, and fix it. This is the easy part for me, though you may learn differently.

The hard part is being able to help explain this knowledge to others. Once you've known something for awhile, it can be difficult to remember the pain points you had while learning. It's even harder to teach someone who learns or thinks differently from you. Walk them through the knowledge the best you can. Don't just tell them the solution (especially if it's an assignment). Lead them to the answer, and make sure they are the ones doing the critical thinking. _Most the time re-framing a problem or finding the right example is all someone needs._

If someone doubts that they can know as much about a subject as you, be sure to tell them that the only reason you have it is because of time and curiosity, and that they can get to that point too. 

The three topics you need to be _knowledgeable abut are open source, Git, and (to a lesser degree) Linux_. These are the three big things people will expect you to know about, this being an open source club. You don't need to be an expert, but feel confident that you can help people with the fundamentals of these. 

### Meetings

> Oversee officer and general body meetings

For every meeting, it is always important to _be welcoming and willing to help both new and regular members_.

I'll tackle GBMs first. GBMs serve two purposes. The first is to educate people about a specific topic. The second is a way to bring new students to a club event. They need to be engaging and not overwhelming. The best way I found to do this is to make the GBMs into workshops. This makes students practice what you're going over, and more likely to remember it. 

Casual Coding Sessions are meant to give members time to work on projects, help people learn, and create a collaborative environment. I think it does the later two parts really well. Unfortunately working on projects is difficult. I'll get more into this in the projects section, but I think people have trouble focusing in casual coding. A quieter environment (whether that be separate rooms or scheduled times) and setting a precedent by working on projects might go a long way.

Be sure to keep officer meetings brief and informative. The goal is to make sure everyone is up-to-date and make important decision. Keep in the mind officers already spend a lot of time on the club and have other commitments too.

One meeting type we haven't explored much is a mini-hackathon where we would go over a certain topic and work on projects dealing with that topic. This could help bring in people and get members to do stuff, but would be a long time commitment and require some subject matter expertise. 

Oh and don't forget to put up the sign in link and actually sign in. 

### Projects

> Acting project lead for projects without a project lead

Before I get into best practices for projects I want to talk about working with project leads. Give them the freedom they need to manage their project. Make sure they have the resources they need. But keep on them so they make projects accessible (resources), are active on their slack channels/GitHub, and make progress. Offer assistance and push them when necessary.

Projects should be approachable. _Use the standard project structure from the resources repo_. This lets everyone know where to find information and familiarizes themselves with standard open source practices. The docs folder should hold valuable resources to both learn about the tech behind the project and how the project itself works. Diagrams are definitely as plus too. 

Make use of GitHub's project management features. Liberally use issues (with tags like beginner friendly), projects, and milestones to help people know what needs to be done and how to do that. Also, let people know these exists and how to use them. 

Also be active on the slack. Make announcements about progress, answer questions, and thank people for their work. 

As for the technical side of things, _keep it simple_. Write code to deal with your current problems, not in anticipation of something that may or may not be an issue later. Separate everything into logical sections, and abstract out their interactions (don't tie the core logic of a program to a specific type of database or UI). You should be able to cut out your code and use someone elses' regardless of actual implementation.  

The most difficult part about projects is getting people involved and actively working on them. We try to lower the entry barrier by putting out useful information and being their to help. The other aspect needed is motivation. Sometimes people don't feel comfortable with a language or tool. They'll be tempted to just be "practicing", because they feel they aren't good enough. Help teach them the best you can, but give them an actual job. Otherwise they'll get stuck in an infinite loop. Some responsibility or expectation can help motivate someone. If it could be done better, sit with them and walk through their work. Once people actually start coding, assign deadlines so people try to meet them and not keep putting it off. 

### Officers

> Oversee officers and projects

Officers are officers because they care about the club. Be sure to spread out the workload (something I've had to work at) or else you or another officer might burn out. Get their opinion on any problems or ideas that pop up. And be sure to ask how they are doing, because some people are to stubborn to ask for help unprompted. 

### Other Organizations and Funding

We are an entity under Student Activities and Involvement (SAI). That means we aren't controlled by any other organization (ACM or MOSSN), though that doesn't mean we don't want to work with them. We can also request funding through SAI, though it can be a frustrating process. 

We are also a Special Interest Group (SIG) of ACM. This is for two reasons: 1. It makes it easy for us to work with other clubs on events to advertise ourselves and spread open source information, 2. They provide a funding source. We do have to do certain things (go to ACM + SIG meetings, advertise their events, etc) as defined by ACM (and on their ACM + SIG Facebook page). Be sure to call them out if they seem to be over stepping their bounds or doing something you're not comfortable with. Most the time I've done it, other clubs have felt the same way, but haven't brought it up. 

The Mozilla Open Source Student Network (MOSSN) is a bit of a new program. We are one of the founding clubs and it's still getting it's footing. It's goal is to help students learn about, and start working on open source projects. As of writing this they are trying to provide resources on activities, mentors that we can connect with, and connection with other MOSSN clubs to do joint projects.

Be sure to work with other clubs, including those outside of the SIG group. Most will want a tech presentation, but doing a joint event or project would be very cool. Though in a way we compete for student time, it's better we _work with other clubs_. We aren't targeting every CS student, so working together to to teach or do something cool should primarily be done to teach or do something cool.  

### Accounts

> Access to all club accounts

Here are a list of thing's we own and/or need to be updated. Note: maintaining most of these is the duty of other officers, but check in on them occasionally

Also be sure to get the login details for all of these accounts

- Club email
	- gator.osc@gmail.com
	- Check on this regularly as people will ask questions this way, especially from Gator Connect
- Google Drive
	- Try to keep most files on the GitHub instead of the Drive
		- GitHub is better for things like club procedures, meeting notes, and resources so people can see them 
		- Be sure to remove any duplicate files on both to avoid problems knowing which is most up-to-date
	- Keep all files well organized
		- Presentations in the correct GBM folder
			- If you are reusing/modifying a presentation be sure to not touch the original and make a copy instead
			- This is because we share certain topic presentations on our GitHub and we don't want to modify that content after the fact
			- If you are deliberately updating a topic presentation, make a copy and just update the link, don't modify history
	- Sign-ins
		- We've been using a Google Sheet for each year (same tinyurl link for the calendar year)
		- Label what each sign-in was for so we know when reviewing meetings
- Google Calendar
	- Be sure to use the "Open Source Club" calendar, not the "UF OSC" one
	- Populate this at the beginning of the semester and fill in details as you go
		- This helps us plan and let's others know what's happening to try to avoid conflicts
	- Also copy our events over to the "ACM Master Calendar" so others know when we are meeting
	- You can also reserve the Fishbowl with the "Fishbowl Reservation Calendar"
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ufosc/)
	- Post 
		- Have events created at least a week ahead of time (GBMs even more)
		- Share GBMs at least a few times before they happen
			- In the OSC page
			- UF ACM
			- UF Computer Science
			- Other relevant ones
		- Other engagement might help get people active
			- Open Source project of the week
			- General tech news
			- Project status/help of the week
	- Banners
		- Use the logos from the logo repo
		- Be sure to use the ACM labeled ones for events
	- Notifications
		- Per [this](https://www.facebook.com/help/167159300010051?helpref=related), members aren't notified about events on Facebook
		- One workaround would be making a bot that would invite everyone
	- Third party posters
		- Don't let people use our page to advertise for their business, we aren't a job board
		- Do let clubs (ACM) that we collaborate with posts events we are involved with
	- Other
		- We aren't in the Florida group (we set our location to Gainesville when creating the group), so people don't need to add their UFL emails to Facebook to join
		- The pinned post should be created by the current President (as people will message you thinking your in charge) and have a link to our intro, slack, email, and GitHub
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ufosc)
	- Resources
		- The repo has lots of useful information outlined below, _keep adding/updating it_
		- Intro
			- An introduction to our club, easy way to onboard members
		- Resource
			- Has pages that explain some topic and provide links to useful information about them
		- Project template
			- This sets out a template to use for projects
			- The explain file should walk through the meaning of everything
			- Anything bolded needs to be changed for each specific project
		- Presentation
			- This has links to different topics we've covered
				- Share these links, as opposed to the Google Drive link
				- This way we can provide additional information (like other links)
				- Also means if we update the slides, the links are still valid
			- Don't need to recreate a presentation each time
			- By all means update them, following guidelines I mention in the Google Drive section
		- Coding guidelines
			- This has useful advice about coding and style guidelines for different languages
			- The idea is this is something useful to get projects started, not that they all have to abide by them
			- Just keep style easily readable (so more people can read the code and help)
	- Club Documents
		- This stores club management specific files, things only officers need, and notes about meetings
	- Logo
		- Contains all of the assets the club uses
		- Be sure to put t-shirt and other designs here too
	- Practice repo
		- A repo people can practice Git with (it has nothing useful on it)
		- Great for when your doing cross club collaborations
	- Other repos
		- Should all be projects
		- Don't delete anything that has code
			- Older projects could be revitalized after all
	- Teams
		- Use GitHub teams to give access to each project
			- Add everyone to the members list so they can all accesses the practice repo for instance
			- Every other group (aside from officers) is for a specific project 
			- Make sure any new group is under the members group
- [Website](https://ufosc.github.io/)
	- Currently on the ufosc.github.io repo
	- Needs an update
	- Keep in mind this is how people might find out about the club
		- Make sure it points to the intro and any other useful information (that is kept up-to-date)
- [Slack](https://ufosc.slack.com/)
	- Channels
		- Keep the announcements channel for announcements (or questions about events) only
		- General is for general chatter
		- Topic/project specific channels for anything else
			- Be very active and encourage people who are
		- Archive any unused channels to not overload new members
	- Slack bots
		- We have two bots right now that need a little maintenance occasionally
		- A GitHub bot that pushes notifications about GitHub activity
			- Need to add each repo individually in order to be notified
		- A greeter bot that sends an introductory message to each new member
			- This will message a link and explanation about all the channels to people when they join
	- Be sure to update pinned posts and topics
- [UF Listerve](https://lists.ufl.edu/)
	- Management interface is the bottom link
	- This is what controls the email announcements 
	- Update this from the email sign up (linked off of Facebook and on the Google Drive) and the meeting sign-in 
	- Instructions on how to use it are saved on the Google Drive under resources
- [Gator Connect](https://orgs.studentinvolvement.ufl.edu/Organization/Open-Source-Club)
	- We have to update this at the beginning of each fall to stay an official Student Government club
	- New students may find us this way
	- The site is pretty awful so we don't use it for anything else
- [Mozilla Open Source Student Network](https://opensource.mozilla.community/)
	- More on this in the other organization section
	- We have a profile here that should be updated
	- Officers don't have to post their profiles here, but it is encouraged
- [Reitz union ](https://virtualems.union.ufl.edu/)
	- We schedule through them because they are much more responsive and provide better rooms than UF Stars
	- Do it as far out as you can to keep a consistent room
	- Keep in mind food has to be ordered from their food service to be allowed
	- Call the Building manager at (352) 260-3545 to open up the room
- [DIBS](http://cms.uflib.ufl.edu/studyroom)
	- Great for Causal Coding as Marston rooms are smaller and close to classes
	- Have people on top of reserving rooms as they can go quickly
	- It's too bad we can't have a bot that reserves these automatically
- [Club Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/ufosc)
	- An open source alternative to Google Hangouts
	- Does occasionally have issues, so use Hangouts as a back up for meetings
- [Club GitHub Profile](https://github.com/ufosc-offical)
	- It's been used for examples before
	- Could be made the owner of the OSC organization
- Google+
	- These are both dead, as no one uses them, but here they are
	- [Profile](https://plus.google.com/u/0/105319997428264602058)
	- [Organization](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117962296950277222685)

### Other

Our official name is the Open Source Club, with OSC being the official abbreviation.

We can not officially have UF or Gator in the club name. Our name is generic enough that I believe it is justifiable to use "UFOSC" or "UF Open Source Club" as an abbreviation or domain on web facing sites, as to not be confused with other open source clubs.

Keep a history of the club and it's progress in the [club-history](../Club-History.md) file and put out a yearly State of the Club (like [this](../../Semesters/2017-Spring/State-of-the-Club.md)). Both of these help to measure club improvement, mark problems encountered, and possible solutions. This is a good spot to learn from and see what solutions have been tried in the past. It also gives credit to past members' work. The State of the Club is also good to send the adviser.

Speaking of adviser, Dr. Hill takes a hands off approach. He has a lot of experience with integrating hardware and software, which could be useful in the future. We have also talked about starting an open source class to give people time to work on projects and learn about open source. He said he would learn more about the process as he was trying do do it with other professors and get back to us.

## Final Thoughts

I realize that was a lot, but I wanted to make sure everything I've been keeping in my mind was written down somewhere. As I mentioned in the preface, please change this as the club evolves. This is not a set of rules that must be followed at all costs, but a guide for getting started. _Be passionate about the club and enjoy the presidency_. I know I did.
