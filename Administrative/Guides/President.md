# President's Guide

## Preface

I'm writing this for a few reasons. The first, and most obvious is to be a guide for future Presidents. I hope what I've learned since starting the club can prove to be valuable. The second is to give other officers a format for creating their own guide. The third and most selfish of me, is to explain why this club masters to me, and what values I would like to see it keeping as it moves forward. 

The other thing I want to make clear is that this is a **living document**. I encourage future presidents to modify it to include their thoughts and give better advice than myself. Don't worry about removing something, we're using Git after all. 

## Responsibilities

- Providing the guiding vision for the club
- Acting project lead for projects without a project lead
- Technical responsibility to be able to help other members
- Oversee officer and general body meetings
- Access to all club accounts
- Oversee officers and projects
- Year-long term

## Advice

I'll break down each point that I think my thoughts can add value to.

> Providing the guiding vision for the club

The club was originally founded with the intent to Promote, Support, and Create Open Source projects. This extends beyond just software, though that is the major audience we attract. We differentiated the club by letting students pitch project ideas, regardless of the topic. 

Letting student's choose the projects can lead to some really creative and unique ideas, but it also means we end up not working on existing projects. While I am very glad students can come upo with their own ideas, we can't forget that open source is about building on existing community work. More of an attempt at working on existing projects would be a good goal.

_Regardless of what you decide to pursue, make it something people can get excited about, and that stays true to open development and leadership._

> Technical responsibility to be able to help other members

This is both the easiest and hardest thing. The way I have learned and grown my knowledge is by staying curious and playing with things. When I see or hear something I'm not familiar with I look into it. Things sometime means I go down a rabbit whole, but I have always ended understanding more. When something really intrigues you, actually install it, or start coding. See what it's good at, see what it's not meant for, break it, and fix it. This is the easy part for me, because it is how I learn and think it might apply to many others, but figure out what works best for you.

The hard part is being able to help explain this knowledge to others. Once you've known something for awhile, it is really hard to remember the hard parts of learning. It's even harder to teach someone who learns or thinks differently from you. Walk them through the knowledge the best you can. Don't just tell them the solution (especially if it's an assignment). Lead them to the answer, and make sure they are the ones doing the critical thinking. Most the time re-framing a problem or finding the right source is all someone needs.

If done well, many people will see this knowledge you've gathered and, in a way, be in awe. This can be powerful and dangerous. People will want to stay and learn from you. But, they may feel as if they can't achieve that. Make sure they know that the only reason you have is because of time and curiosity, and they achieve that too. 

All this being said, be sure to understand as much as you can about open source, Git, and Linux. These are the three big things people will expect you to know about, this being an open source club. You don't need to be an expert, but feel confident that you can help people with the fundamentals of these. 

### Meetings

> Oversee officer and general body meetings

On all of these, the key is to be welcoming and willing to help, to both new and returning members.

I'll tackle GBMs first. GBMs serve two purposes. The first is to educate people about a specific topic. The second is a way to bring new students to a club event. They need to be engaging and not overwhelming. The best way I found to do this is to make the GBMs into workshops. Make sure to have the students practice what you're going over. 

Casual Coding Sessions are meant to give people time to work on projects, help people learn, and create a collaborative environment. I Think it does the later two parts really well. Unfortunately focus on projects is difficult. I'll get more into this in the projects section, but I think people have trouble focusing in casual coding. A quieter environment (whether that be separate rooms or scheduled times) and setting a precedent by working on projects might go a long way.

Be sure to keep officer meetings brief and informative. The goal is to make sure everyone is up-to-date and make important decision. Keep in the mind officers already spend a lot of time on the club.

One meeting type we haven't explored much is a mini-hackathon where we go over a certain topic and work on projects dealing with that topic. This could help bring in people and get members to do stuff, but would be a long time commitment. 

### Projects

> Acting project lead for projects without a project lead

Before I get into best practices for projects I want to talk about working with project leads. Be sure to give them the freedom they need to manage projects. Make sure they have the resources they need. But, be sure they are making projects accessible (resources), active on their slack channels/GitHub, and making progress. Offer assistance and push them when necessary.

Projects should be approachable. Use the standard project structure from the resources repo. This lets everyone know where to find information and familiarizes themselves with standard open source practices. The docs folder should hold valuable resources to both learn about the tech behind the project and how the project itself works. Diagrams are definitely as plus too. 

Make use of GitHub's project management features. Liberally use issues (with tags like beginner friendly), projects, and milestones to help people know what needs to be done and how to do that. Also, let people know these exists. 

Also be active on the slack. Make announcements about progress, answer questions, and thank people for their work. 

As for the technical side of things, keep it simple. Write code to deal with your current problems, not anticipating something that may or may not be an issue. Separate everything into logical sections, and abstract out their interactions (don't tie the core logic of a program to a specific type of database or UI). You should be able to cut out your code and use someone elses (assuming they have the same api) regardless of actual implementation.  

### Officers

> Oversee officers and projects

Officers are officers because they care about the club. Be sure to spread out the workload (something I've had to work at) or else you or another officer might burn out. Get their opinion on any problems or ideas that pop up. And be sure to ask how they are doing, because some people are to stubborn to ask for help unprompted.
