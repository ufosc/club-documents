# Vice President's Guide

## Preface

I am looking at Matthew's guide for formatting help, so I apologize for any blatant "inspiration". The fact is, as Vice President you should take inspiration from the President as much as possible. I am writing this first and foremost, because I think it will help future people in the club. I hope someone in the year 2030 can look back through the repository and find this some day, and get some idea of what we were thinking early on. Second of all, I am doing this because Matthew asked. That's lesson two: do what the President asks.

I have complete faith in my immediate successor, and to be honest, I don't know how much he stands to gain from reading this. That said, I'm happy to offer any help I can, and I'm looking forward to the next year of working together. 

## Responsibilities 

Our club constitution lists only two responsibilities for the Vice President (see below). On one occasion, I could not recall the exact phrase "External Relations Chair", even while describing the exact purpose of the position. I joked with Joe that, "I would rather have a memorable function and a forgettable name, than a memorable name and a forgettable function." 

To some extent, this is true. The two duties (essentially: act as backup President) are rather vague and leave a lot to the imagination. So, I've also listed out some "de facto" roles that I served as. Chances are, your exact roles will depend on the state of the club. So, be ready to handle every problem. The President will steer the club, but you need to be ready to man the harpoon if he is diverted to another area.

### *de jure constitutionis*
- serve as aide to the President
- perform the duties of the President in his/her absence

### *de facto*
- help plan reservations and the meeting schedule
- promote the club
- substitute for other officers
- act as a "whip" to get other members and officers involved


## Advice

Just as Matthew did, I will try to address each of these points. I will mostly focus on my personal experience as VP, and you can draw whatever conclusions you want to.

> serve as aide to the President

If the President of the future is anything like Matthew, chances are the President will serve as a fairly autonomous unit; the President will take on a lot of tasks exclusively for themself. However, there will be many occasions in which the President cannot do one of those mini-tasks. Be ready to do these tasks.

Matthew and I maintained a very steady stream of DMs on slack. Whether you move to Discord, some FOSS chat platform, or passenger pigeon, you should try to maintain that sort of conversation stream. Try to avail yourself as much as possible, especially if you see an opportunity to help out.

More importantly, invest in the wellbeing of the club. Ask questions about the state of the club. Ask how recent events went. Ask the President what they think about the club. Moreover, signal your investment to other members of the club. **Attend every event you can**, and act as the President's hype partner.

> perform the duties of the President in his/her absence

This point speaks for itself. It's another reason to **attend every event**. Be ready to open the GBM, fill in part of the cracks, etc.

> promote the club

At the time of writing, we go to the front of several CS classes to announce our interest meeting at the beginning of the semester. This is expected of every officer, and I think that this practice should continue and even be expanded to non-CS classes. The Vice President should absolutely engage in this practice, and try to announce as much as they can. 

That said, the Vice President (and other officers) should take this practice further. Promote Open Source Club everywhere you go. Say you're "going" to facebook events. Like OSC social media content. Mention OSC to your friends. If you meet someone who might be a good fit, bring them to the meeting. The Vice President should represent the club to the student community. Talk about the club favorably, and demonstrate why people should be involved.

> substitute for other officers

I have already mentioned how the VP should expect to handle some of the President's duties. In addition to being prepared to handle the President's duties at a moment's notice, the VP should be prepared to handle **any** other officer's job. You are the jack-of-all-trades, and you help pick up the slack.

In my personal experience, after our Secretary more or less departed due to personal problems, I wound up handling some of his duties. Be prepared to do something just like this.

> act as a "whip" to get other members and officers involved

I have already mentioned the importance of promoting the club outside the typical areas expected areas. Also important is to keep fellow members and officers engaged. If you see a member while you're in the Dungeon, say hello! Ask what they thought of [event]. Make people feel welcome, and show them how good it is to be part of the club.


## Summary

The best piece of advice I can offer is this: **be a good member**. Be engaged, do things in the club, make friends with the other members, and care. D
