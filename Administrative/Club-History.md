# History of the Open Source Club at UF

## Getting Started

After noticing a lack of general project focused clubs on campus, Matthew Booe (President) brought together Nick Cioli (Vice President) and Nick Barnes (Treasure) and their enthusiasm for open source to create the club at the start of **Spring 2016**. They found Professor Ira Hill to become their faculty advisor. It gathered enough sign-ups to become an official student government organization.

During the first year of operation, there were about five active members. The focus was primarily on teaching Git/Web Design and working on the club website and other basic projects. 

In the middle of **Fall 2016**, the OSC became a Special Interest Group of the UF ACM chapter. The goal of this was to improve relations with the computer science community and find a source of funding.

## Growing Up

There were two problems that became apparent over the previous year: 1. There wasn't a lot of time to work on projects 2. Administrative duties make it really hard to work on other things.

As a result, in the **Spring of 2017** Casual Coding Sessions were introduced as two regular weekly meetings and more officer positions were added. This brought on Anthony Rossello (Secretary), Greg Fussell (External Relations Chair), Will Owens (Social Chair), and Vaibhav Yenamandra (Project Lead).

This helped grow the active members to be above ten people and work on the course planner.

The end of Spring elections resulted in news officers Joe Komskis (External Relations Chair) and Josh Hew (Secretary). A representative from Mozilla also reached out to learn more about the club.

Over the **Summer of 2017** Matthew and Josh worked with Mozilla and eighteen other students to help put together the Mozilla Open Source Student Network.
