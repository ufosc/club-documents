# Workshop Guide

The below guidelines are a set of best practices for people putting on a presentation or workshop for the club. The hope is they will help you create and lead a more informative and useful workshops. Keep in mind these are just guidelines, you don't have to follow them, but at least consider them.

## General Advice

- The most important thing is for your audience to walk away learning something and feeling more confident in the topic. You need to understand the audience in order to do this.
	- Make sure you understand what people want to get out of a talk (and actually do that).
	- Know what level of knowledge your audience will be at (we usually assume basic programming knowledge and not much else). For instance, don't start using the words "repo" or "stack" without first giving an explanation for them.
- Focus on key takeaway points from your topic. People are more likely to remember a few key things then a bunch of little details.
	- A good way to do this is to have an easy to follow use case and/or example for each point.
	- Please don't get lost in the weeds (the unimportant details). Yes it may be useful to know, but it's likely you'll loose people or scare them off.
- Be engaging. No one wants to sit and do nothing but listen for an hour.
	- Interactivity will turn passive listening to active learning (on top of breaking up sections of listening). See the "How" section below for ideas on interactivity.
	- While speaking, keep the presentation exciting and dynamic. This might include: adding jokes, having an interesting story, throwing in a GIF or two, etc. Something that keeps people's attention and helps them to process the information.
- Practice! It not only helps you be more comfortable with speaking, but also means the presentation is reviewed to make it better.
	- Practice by yourself by standing up, projecting like you're actually in-front of a crowd, and time yourself as you go. It's likely you will quickly find spots where thing could be improved.
	- Practice with other people. This is really useful for making sure things don't go to fast and to make sure it assumes the right knowledge level.
- Some other bits of things to keep in mind.
	- Make sure the workshop has an appropriate amount of time. It will take longer than expected if you have any sort of interactivity, so plan accordingly.
	- Because our presentations are at least two weeks apart, each should be self contained. Having a series or presentations that build up on the previous is great for class where you meet every couple days, but it's likely to just make it hard for most people to follow if they miss one.

### Workshop Structure

- Explain the goals of the talk first and what people should walk away with.
- Divide the information into logical sections.
	- Each section should focus on a key point.
	- This has the added benefit, that if all of your audience already knows something, you can safely move onto the next section.
- Recap the takeaway points from each section as you go. Remember, the goal is for people to remember a few important points, and repeating them is a valid way of doing that.
- Have a follow up plan for them to ask questions and learn more.
	- Give them one or two links where they can learn more or a specific project they can get started with. Too many options can discourages people as they can get lost.

### Slide Shows

- Use the slide show as a way to emphasis points, not as the full presentation. 
	- I do encourage adding additional information to the speaker notes to make it easier for people to use the presentation in the future.
- Slides should be easy to read. So use big font and format them consistently.
	- The club has a semi-official Google Slides style. Look at previous presentations to see and use it. 
- The use of relevant images or animations to aid in explanations is highly encouraged.
- **Be sure to save the presentation so we can use it in the future!** This means we can more quickly plan and improve workshops. We've been collecting them in the [resources repository](https://github.com/ufosc/resources/tree/master/presentations).
	- We mostly use Google slides presentations stored in the club's Google Drive account, because these are easy to share and modify.
	- [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) is a neat alternative which could be easily stored in a GitHub repository.

## Types of Meetings

These are two very broad categories, but they should help to specialize the talks. 

### How Workshops
 
These are used to teach people "how" to do something. It's usually preferred over "what" workshops, because they are often more relevant to the club's projects and can be much more interactive.

- In-depth/technical topics
	- Like how to make a web server in Rust.
- Give the audience something to play with first thing.
	- Break it down to explain the important points.
- Modify it live to show people how to do it. It's usually slower and easier to follow.
	- Don't worry about making mistakes. The audience is likely to do it to, so debugging will show them how they can solve it too.
	- But do keep backups of working code so you can switch to those if necessary.
- Give people things to do.
	- Have them follow along and build it up as the workshop goes so they have something cool to take home and play with.
	- Consider pairing people up or having an assistant help people in small groups.
	- Make sure everyone catches up before moving on.

### What Workshops

These are used to teach people "what" something is. This caters to higher level workshops where conveying concepts is the objective.

- High level topics
	- Like what a cryptocurrencies is or why someone should switch to Linux.
- Even though they don't lend themselves to interactivity and building things, do provide examples or stories.
	- For instance, there are a lot of websites that can provide interactive examples for things like Git or how cryptocurrency miners work.
